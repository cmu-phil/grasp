Materials, code, datasets, etc., for the GRaSP project

# Simulation Datasets

These are available on Box here:

https://cmu.box.com/s/h2e6ab9a62u2yu7kytg5ejsbyijsoc1u

This includes all dataset in tabular form plus all true graphical models for the dataset
to compare results to.

# Simulation Results

These may be downloaded from this GitHub site; please download the file,

grasp_results.zip

This includes all specific algorithms results for the simulation figures in our paper plus
summary results in the Comparison.txt files; the latter are what are plotted in our
simulation Figures.

# Ground truth Independence Models (IMs)

The 4-node ground truth models may be downloaded from their source as referenced in our paper.
The 5-node canceling models in Appendix F may be downloaded from this repository
in this file:

udag5.zip

# Real Dataset Repository

A number of real datasets have been formatted with ground truth for easy analysis using 
causal discovery algorithms in this GitHub repository

https://github.com/cmu-phil/example-causal-datasets

Users are encouraged to analyze these dataset using own algorithms. We are in the process 
of preparing a parallel GitHub repository of causal algorithm result graphs, for a variety
of causal algorithms currently in use, including our own but also algorithms from other
projects, for head-to-head comparison. We hope to make this second repository pubicly 
available in the near future, once we feel we've given all of the algorithms a fair
shot at success.

# PC/FGES/GRaSP0/GRaSP1/GRaSP2 on a subset of these real dataset.

We will upload these as a PDF file soon to this reposotiry

# Code

All Java code for our published paper is included in this branch of the GitHub 
repository for the Tetrad project:

https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/tree/grasp-pub

We are intending to translate GRaSP-2 into Python soon.
